## Web-Scraping-Challenge

I found that this assignment was very challenging especially because web scraping is tedious work and different solutions work for different websites.  It was extreemly hard to get the tweet I finally got it then learned it was no longer needed and removed from the assignment. (I still feel a win!) 
I had trouble getting the code for the mongo and flask to work seemlessly, The pressure was building because we also were working on a team project.  I fell a little short on this Web scraping challenge although please consider my code should be almost perfect. Also the instructons could have explained the scrap function better that was a bump in the road also.. Overall this was an outstanding learning experiance. Thank you!
