## 12-Web-Scraping-Challenge (regrade)

## Dawn Salisbury

## Welcome to Mars Scrape Data

## NOTE:  Please use the Missions-to-Mars folder for the regrading and NOT the one marked "OLD"

Please consider this a regrade I have reworked and completed the assignment the outcome was extreemly challenging but worth wild.
As of my resubmission the scrape data collects the following, on the day you grade we might see more current.

## Featured Mars News: 
September 4, 2020
Did you know NASA's next Mars rover has a nearly identical sibling on Earth for testing? Even better, it's about to roll for the first time through a replica Martian landscape.

## Mars Hemiphere 

### Mosaic,Cerberus hemisphere
Mosaic of the Cerberus hemisphere of Mars projected into point perspective, a view similar to that which one would see from a spacecraft. This mosaic is composed of 104 Viking Orbiter images acquired on February 11, 1980. At that time, it was early northern summer on Mars. The center of the image is at latitude 3 degrees, longitude 185 degrees.

### Schiaparelli Hemisphere Enhanced
Mosaic of the Schiaparelli hemisphere of Mars projected into point perspective, a view similar to that which one would see from a spacecraft. The images were acquired in 1980 during early northern summer on Mars. The center of this image is near the impact crater Schiaparelli (latitude -3, longitude 343) The limits of this mosaic are approximately latitude -60 to 60 and longitude 260 to 30. The color variations have been enhanced by a factor of two, and the large-scale brightness normalized by large-scale filtering.

### Syrtis Major Hemisphere Enhanced
Mosaic of the Syrtis Major hemisphere of Mars projected into point perspective, a view similar to that which one would see from a spacecraft. This mosaic is composed of about 100 red and violet filter Viking Orbiter images, digitally mosaicked in an point perspective projection. The images were acquired in 1980 during early northern summer on Mars. The center of this image is near latitude 0 degrees, longitude 310 degrees, and the limits of this mosaic are approximately latitude -60 to 60 and longitude 260 to 350. The color variations have been enhanced by a factor of two, and the large-scale brightness normalized by large-scale filtering.

### Valles Marineris Hemisphere Enhanced
Mosaic of the Valles Marineris hemisphere of Mars projected into point perspective, a view similar to that which one would see from a spacecraft. The distance is 2500 kilometers from the surface of the planet, with the scale being .6km/pixel. The mosaic is composed of 102 Viking Orbiter images of Mars. The center of the scene (lat -8, long 78) shows the entire Valles Marineris canyon system, over 2000 kilometers long and up to 8 kilometers deep, extending form Noctis Labyrinthus, the arcuate system of graben to the west, to the chaotic terrain to the east. Many huge ancient river channels begin from the chaotic terrain from north-central canyons and run north. The three Tharsis volcanoes (dark red spots), each about 25 kilometers high, are visible to the west. South of Valles Marineris is very ancient terrain covered by many impact craters.
